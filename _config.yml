          I initiated my web development career at this esteemed company, rapidly progressing over nearly a decade from novice to expert.

          Previously trained as a photographer, I found photography opportunities dwindling as the company branched into new business sectors. To adapt, I independently learned JavaScript and PHP, expanding my skill set to accommodate the changing landscape.

          My newfound skills were put to test in a pilot project with a long-standing client, providing a favorable environment for practical application and growth. Despite a generous deadline, the successful completion of the project brought satisfaction to both the client and myself.

          Today, we work closely with our clients to develop tailored web-based software solutions, primarily serving B2B needs like digital asset management, approval processes, and other business functions.

          In 2010 I started a professional training as a photographer at a small photostudio for portraits and advertising near Bremen.
          I soon realized that taking photos of people is not my biggest skill. So I focused on product and advertisement photography. In 2013 I successfully graduated.
